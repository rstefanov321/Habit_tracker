# Habit_tracker
An application which uses Pixela to keep track of your progress on a given goal - cycling/walking/steps per day, metres swum for the day, etc. The goal of the app is to show the features of APIs when presenting a progress in a graphical way. 
In addition to this, the method "strftime" from the datetime module is used to align the current date format with the one required by Pixela's API.
